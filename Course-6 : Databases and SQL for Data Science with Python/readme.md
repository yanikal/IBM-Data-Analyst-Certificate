## About this Course

Working knowledge of SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a must for data professionals like Data Scientists, Data Analysts and Data Engineers. Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL is a powerful language used for communicating with and extracting data from databases.  

In this course you will learn SQL inside out- from the very basics of Select statements to advanced concepts like JOINs.  

You will:  
- write foundational SQL statements like: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE 
- filter result sets, use WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT clauses 
- differentiate between DML & DDL  
- CREATE, ALTER, DROP and load tables 
- use string patterns and ranges; ORDER and GROUP result sets, and built-in database functions 
- build sub-queries and query data from multiple tables  
- access databases as a data scientist using Jupyter notebooks with SQL and Python 
- work with advanced concepts like Stored Procedures, Views, ACID Transactions, Inner & Outer JOINs 

Through hands-on labs and projects, you will practice building SQL queries, work with real databases on the Cloud, and use real data science tools. In the final project you’ll analyze multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate your skills.  
  
#### What you will learn : 
  
- Analyze data within a database using SQL and Python.

- Create a relational database on Cloud and work with tables.

- Write SQL statements including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

- Build more powerful queries with advanced SQL techniques like views, transactions, stored procedures and joins. 


**The purpose of this course** is to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.  

**The emphasis in this course** is on hands-on and practical learning . As such, you will work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. You will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs you will practice building and running SQL queries. You will also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

## Final Course Assignment
This folder contains data files and a Jupyter Notebook script that demonstrates use of a variety of SQL commands to query the three datasets.  
* _Census_Data.csv_ contains six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” by Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012. For more detailed information, see the [data description](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2).  
* _Chicago_Crime_Data.csv_ reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. For more detailed information, see the [data description](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2).  
* _Chicago_Public_Schools.csv_ shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. For more detailed information, see the [data description](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t).  
* _Chicago_Datasets_PeerAssign-v5.ipynb_ contains the script with ipython-sql code, which is used to query the datasets after they were loaded into a Db2 database on IBM Cloud.
